You see those crasher videos going around, such as Trava_discord.mp4, Indian tech support saying "Your computer has virus" or Mario saying "Nice computer you have. Can I have it?". You want to make one? Great. Keep reading.

# Usage
Just drag-and-drop the video you want to make crasher, to the executable file.
Or alternatively, you can specify the path of your input and/or output file from the command line.
```
DiscordCrasherVideoGenerator.exe C:\path\to\your\mom\input.mp4
DiscordCrasherVideoGenerator.exe C:\path\to\your\mom\input.mp4 C:\path\to\your\mom\output.mp4
```

# Notice
Be sure that you have installed .NET 5 runtime.
Don't use a video that's too short. Like, use 8 or 9 seconds at least.
Also, be sure that the file's name is full of alphanumeric letters. Don't put any space, special character, number, etc.
